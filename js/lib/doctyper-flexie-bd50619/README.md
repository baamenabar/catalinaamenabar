Flexie
===============
Legacy support for the [CSS3 Flexible Box Model](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/).

See it in Action?
=================
[Flexie Playground](http://doctyper.github.com/flexie/playground/)

Ready For Prime Time?
=====================
...Possibly.

Browser Support
===============
* IE 6-9
* Opera 10.0+

The Flexible Box Model is [supported natively](http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) by these browsers:

* Firefox 3.0+
* Safari 3.2+
* Chrome 5.0+

Webkit browsers (Safari + Chrome) have incomplete support for the box-align property. Flexie normalizes this property in Webkit browsers.


Currently Supported Properties
==============================
* box-orient
* box-align
* box-direction
* box-pack
* box-flex
* box-flex-group
* box-ordinal-group


Not There Yet
=============
* box-lines (as far as I can tell, no browser currently supports this property)


Why?
=======
I *really* wanted to use the CSS3 Flexible Box Model.


How?
=======
It works like [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com). In fact, it uses Selectivizr's engine to traverse your style sheets and looks for `display: box` elements. After that, it looks for any of the currently supported properties.

Note: Flexie looks for non-namespaced properties. For example, it will ignore `-moz-box-pack`, but not `box-pack`. For best results, make sure to use a non-namespaced property. But you were already doing that to future-proof your code, weren't you?

No setup on your end, just stick Flexie in your markup after your [selector engine of choice](http://selectivizr.com/#things).

Requirements
============
See the [Things you need to know](http://selectivizr.com/#things)

Also, a caveat. As of FF 4.0 / Chrome 7 / Safari 5, Gecko and Webkit differ slightly in their flexbox implementations. <strike>Of note is their default values. Webkit will default to `box-align: start`, while Gecko defaults to the spec-defined `box-align: stretch`. Make sure your flexbox CSS works on both these browsers before adding Flexie.</strike>

* As of version 0.7, Flexie normalizes the `box-align` property across Webkit browsers.
* As of version 0.8, Flexie normalizes the `box-pack` property in Gecko.
